<p>Development Impact (DIME) is a department of the World Bank’s Development Economics Vice-Presidency, with the purpose of increasing use of impact evaluation (IE) in the design and implementation of public policy and to develop institutional capacity and motivation for evidence-based policy. Part of DIME’s mission is to intensify the production of and access to public goods that improve the quantity and quality of global development research, while lowering the costs of doing IE for the entire research community.
<br />
DIME Analytics is a centralized team within DIME that develops and ensures adoption of high-quality research practices across DIME’s large global portfolio. DIME Analytics takes advantage of the concentration and scale of research at DIME to identify constraints and inefficiencies in the research production cycle and develop and iteratively test solution.</p>
